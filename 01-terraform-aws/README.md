# Terraform AWS


Before we can start with Terraform on AWS we'll need to login with the AWS cli. Terraform will use the local cli credentials to run commands

1. Login to AWS console
  https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home#

  | Account ID | 257034520079 |
  | ---------- | ------------ |
  | Username   | userN        |
  | Password   |              |


2. In the top right corner, click on your username and go to `Security credentials`

3. Under `Access Keys` click `Create access key`
a. `Command Line Interface (CLI)
b. Accept the risks, next
c. Take note of the `Access Key` and `Secret Access Key`

4. On your workstation the following
```bash
aws configure
```
```
AWS Access Key ID [****************5TF7]:
AWS Secret Access Key [****************lJti]:
Default region name [ca-central-1]:
Default output format [None]:
```
5. You can run the following to test your credentials. You should see your ARN
```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

## First Deployment

Create a new file called `main.tf`, this will be the primary definition of the our deployment

### Prerequisites
In that file, start by declaring the versions we want to use.

```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.99"
    }
  }

  required_version = ">= 1.12.0"
}
```

This will do a few things. It will tell terraform we want to use the `hashicorp/aws` plugin and the latest of the 5.99 (which is the most current at the time of creating this).

These scripts have also been tested on terraform cli version 1.12 and it will set that as a minimum version.


Next we will provide some minimum data to the aws plugin. This information can be found in the plugin's [documentation|https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/5.99.1/docs]

*main.tf*
```
provider "aws" {
  region = "ca-central-1"
}
```

### Networking

For the first example. We'll deploy a public network, with a internet gateway and a VM that will be remotely accesible

*main.tf*
```
# VPC
resource "aws_vpc" "vpc" {
  cidr_block = "10.N.0.0/16"
  tags = {
    Name = "userN"
  }
}

# Subnet
resource "aws_subnet" "public" {
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.vpc.id
  cidr_block        = "10.N.1.0/24"
  availability_zone = "ca-central-1a"
  tags = {
    Name = "userN"
  }
}

```

## Deploying

Before we can deploy anthing we need to initailize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```
Terraform will look for any `.tf` files in the current folder and read the `required_providers` and download any that are missing. In this case, you should see it fetch the latest aws plugin.

Once initialized we can `plan` the deployment. Terraform will again read the tf files and give a report on what it will be doing to get to the desired state.

```bash
terraform plan
```

You'll notice every line starts with a `+` this is because currently nothing exist so evertything will be created. Which is exactl what we want so we are good to go ahead a apply this terraform file

```bash
terraform apply
```

Terraform will show you the same plan again, there is a way to save a plan and just tell it to use the already planed changes but for now we'll let it recreate it.

Once done, it'll prompt you to continue. Type `yes` exactly. y or anything else will not work.

Once completed you can go back to the AWS consol and find your new VPC and subnet.


### Internet Accesible

To be able to reach the VMs from here we'll need to make them publicly accessible. First thing we create is an internet gateway. You can think of this as a enpoint on the public router. Next is a default route for the subnet that sends any unknown destination to that new IG. Lastly is the Security Group. For this you'll need to know your public IP, if you need to find it out you can run the below command from your computer not the workstation, or search "what's my ip" and your search engine should tell you.

Current IP:
```bash
curl ifconfig.me
```

*main.tf*
```
# Internet Gateway
resource "aws_internet_gateway" "ig" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.vpc.id
}
# Internet Route
resource "aws_route" "route" {
  route_table_id = aws_vpc.userN.default_route_table_id
  destination_cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
  gateway_id = aws_internet_gateway.ig.id
}

# Security Group
resource "aws_security_group" "sg" {
  name        = "UserN SG"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.vpc.id

  ingress {
    description = "ssh in"
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["<current IP>/32"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```

After adding the above we can apply the new changes

```bash
terraform apply
```

### VM


*main.tf*
```
resource "aws_key_pair" "key" {
  key_name   = "userN"
  public_key = "ssh-rsa AAAAB... email@example.com"
}

resource "aws_instance" "vm" {
  ami                         = "ami-0df0e72a56b129d1f"
  instance_type               = "t2.micro"
  key_name                    = aws_key_pair.key.key_name
  vpc_security_group_ids      = [ aws_security_group.sg.id ]
  subnet_id                   = aws_subnet.public.id
  associate_public_ip_address = true

  tags = {
    Name = "userN"
  }
}
```
